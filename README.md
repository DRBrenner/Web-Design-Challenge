# Web-Design-Challenge

# Purpose

The purpose of this school project was to create a website summarizing and visualizing my analysis of how weather changes as one gets closer to the equator. In a previous homework assignment, I randomly selected 1500 latitude and longitude pairs and used citipy to find the nearest city to each pair. I then performed a weather check on each resulting unique city using a series of successive API calls to OpenWeatherMap API. Dropping duplicate cities and/or incomplete weather elements resulted in a complete dataset of 544 cities. I used python and Matplotlib to graph latitude versus various other weather elements.
